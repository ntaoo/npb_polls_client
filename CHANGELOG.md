# 1.0.1

### Replaced sass with scissors(with pruneCss: false).

scissors is actively maintained, compiles scss fast with sassc, and also provides various useful functions such as image optimizing.

I disabled scissors's pruneCss function in this project at present since it breaks standing_component's style with `ViewEncapsulation.None` (konwn limitation).

##### Also, reduced an image size.

# 1.0.0

Initial release.
